# Dialogue Generator

This is a program I created to facilitate the creation of the .json files that my dialogue system uses. <br>
I don't know how you can practically use this, because is for my specific data structure <br>
But you can always create you own dialogues and send it to me so I can add it to the game. <br> <br>
The progress and more information about the game will be published in my twitter account Arturony3.

# How to use it

1. Load one of the .json files included in the release, or press "New" in the "File" menu. <br>
2. You will see the current nodes of the graph and the edges of that graph. <br>
3. To add a new one, fill the "Key" area with an ID that is not present in the list <br>
4. Fill the value and check, or not, the checkbox. <br>
The "Restrictions" button doesn't work right now <br>
5. Press "Add" and the new key will be shown in the list <br>
6. To add a edge, select the node which will be the starting point
7. Fill the areas like the steps before and hit "Add" <br>

Then save the file with the desired name
